# Homework-5
Day Planner
I was able to complete all requirements, found bootstrap template and made edits to fit my criteria then create JS from scratch. 

UPDATE***
if you look at my script.js file starting on line52 you can see i start comparing time blocks and console.log future/past/present depnding on max/=/else.
The console result is correct but for some reason the addClass is not setting the right color, they are all green which is future.  Not sure why since console log is showing correct results.
